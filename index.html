                <p>My name is Sarah Coulson and I live in Houston, TX as of 2021 but, I was born in Colorado Springs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have always had an interest in technology since I was younger. Whether that was playing games on a computer or if it was 
                    coding games. I recieved the award of Houston Area Honorable Mention from the National Center for Women In Technology in 2019.
                    My dream job is to be an Aerospace Engineer or to be in a field that has something to do with space or planes. I want to be a rocket scientist.

                </p>
                <p>
                  I'm looking forward to becoming a web developer to be able to help so many different individuals or have a greater impact and develop a website
                  for an employer that would have a larger audience and make a larger impact.  
                </p>
